# CXX

# SUMMARY
Intro


Intro:
This project aims at providing a minimal configuration for any C++ project with CMake to manage source files compilation and GoogleTest to test implemented functions. 
A Python script has also been implemented to convert GoogleTest results to a JUnit format.
A continuous integration chain has been setup using Jenkins. 
A Docker has also been created for this repository. K8S is used to orchestrate N dockers.

To begin
1 - Create build directory and do:
cd build; cmake ..; make

The executable is created in the build folder.

(cmd + shift + p then reload window, select compiler to create a cmake project)

To configure a CMake project:
add a folder .vscode, add a file na√πed settings.json, with
{
    "C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools"
}
This repo is made of 2 directories : one containing the source code of the application and the other everything related to testing. To run the application,a third folder (build) needs to be created.
build will containg everything that is created : Makefile, cached files, binaries
in cxx, advanced_math and base_math are example directory that could in a real project be replaced as librairies.

Next time: 
add second library: OK
add google tests 
move main directory inside cxx : OK
debugging
